<paragraph><sentence> TITLE:	Elemental measurements in vision</sentence>.</paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>What are the "elements" of early vision</sentence>?  <sentence>I will discuss a unifying framework under which the basic visual measurements can be derived in a consistent manner</sentence>.  <sentence>First we must consider the structure of the
light in which a visual organism is immersed; this may be formalized with the "plenoptic function," which is related to Gibson's concept of the optic array</sentence>.  <sentence>Derivative operators on this function produce measurements of form, motion, color, flicker, disparity, and so on</sentence>.  <sentence>We can derive a kind of periodic table of early vision</sentence>.</paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>I will also discuss some of our work on early vision using "steerable filters" and "steerable pyramids" to analyze orientation, scale, local energy, and so on</sentence>.  <sentence>The steerable pyramid has advantages over other multiscale image decompositions -- including the currently popular orthogonal wavelet transforms</sentence>.</paragraph>
